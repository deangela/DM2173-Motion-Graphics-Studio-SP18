### SHOW & TELLS / REVERSE STORYBOARD

---

* You will either volunteer for or be assigned from the list below or discuss an alternate choice that is not on the list with the professor. 
* After quickly researching the choices, please post on the class main slack channel, mgs_sp18, your show and tell choice. First come first serve.
* Show and tells are due on the date listed on the course [schedule](schedule.md).
* Show a reel OR at least 3 examples of work of your chosen artist, designer, director, filmmaker, or company. Try to obtain hi-res footage if at all possible. Make sure you use the *designers + studios*  dropdown menu at the top of the [Art Of The Title](http://www.artofthetitle.com) website to do research for your show and tell. ALMOST all of them should be there. Not all of them will be there.
* Be familiar with a brief bio and be prepared to CRITICALLY discuss your assigned artist, designer, director, filmmaker, or company and their supporting footage in a dynamic presentation in front of the class
* Select one of the 3 examples of their work to reverse storyboard, by getting screenshots of three key frames. Analyze these key frames using vocabulary from Motion Design by Matt Woolman. **Upload this reverse storyboard as a pdf with the 3 screenshots and written analysis to the MGS slack channel.**
